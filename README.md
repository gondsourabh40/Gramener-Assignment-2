# Gramener-Assignment
I have done this assignment of second question of classification of good or bad user for loan 

Approach to solve this problem:

Firstly i converted all categorical data to numerical for feed into the machine Learning models,
then I find outliers in the dataset and removed it after it i preprocessed all columns and remove some columns which are not too much related with good/bad column like purpose and then i applied 4 machine learning model and all model giving accuracy as more than 70%
and as for get accurate accuracy i used k-fold cross validation technique
Accuracy of all 4 models:

0)	RandomForestClassifier	0.78
1)	SVC	0.73
2)	GaussianNB	0.72
3)	KNeighborsClassifier	0.72

so the best model is RandomForestClassifier

I hope you got my approach and you will like my solution of a problem

I have also explained it in python notebook with proper explanation and visualisation

Thank You:)
